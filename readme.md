# Math 652 Project

## To-Do Checklist

### Manuscript
- [ ] **Abstract**: Motivate the problem(s), and summarize your work.
- [ ] **Introduction**: Should include a statement of the project objectives and clearly state the scientific questions of interest.
- [ ] **Methods & Materials**: Should include a brief description of the problem and the data (with reference to the data source(s)). This section can also include a quantitative and graphical summary of individual variables and relationships between variables of interest. Clearly indicate the methods applied and specific models considered (e.g., when conducting a hypothesis test, clearly state the null and alternative hypotheses in this section).
    - The scope of the statistical methods required to analyze your data should contain two methods where at least one of the methods you will have learned in the course, e.g.:
        1. Chapter 5: Inference about the Mean Vector
        2. Chapter 6: Comparisons of Several Multivariate Means
        3. Chapter 7: Multivariate Linear Regression Models
        4. Chapter 8: Principal Components
        5. Chapter 9: Factor Analysis
        6. Chapter 10: Canonical Correlation Analysis
        7. Chapter 11: Discrimination and Classification
        8. Chapter 12: Clustering, Distance Methods, and Ordination
    - You are required to check the assumptions and conditions for the methods you use and justify your choices. If the normality assumption is not reasonable for the standard methods above, consider analogous nonparametric methods where able, or proceed with the chosen statistical method noting that this is an exercise and explaining how the assumptions are not met.
- [ ] **Results**: Summarize the results as much as possible with clear reference to tables and figures. All tables and figures presented should have captions and be clearly referenced in the text.
- [ ] **Discussion and Conclusions**: Summarize your project, clearly discussing your findings and conclusions. This section can also discuss any limitations of your study, and potential future work (if applicable)
- [ ] **Bibliography**: Use a citation format appropriate for your discipline.

### Questions
- [ ] Are there underlying but unobserved variables (skill level, fitness, etc) which determine the statistics?
- [ ] Can we predict player salary, winning, season awards? Can we predict team success?
- [ ] Can we show statistical significance between the in-game stats of groups of high achievers compared to other peers?
- [ ] Can we show statistical significance between in-game stats of different teams at the pro-level? Compared to college level? Can we say that a change of coaches make a significant difference in player performance?

### Methods
- [ ] Multivariate multiple regression, including variable selection (e.g. using AIC)
- [ ] Multivariate anove (MANOVA) - groupings could be teams, pro vs college
- [ ] PCA and/or factor analysis
- [ ] Paired comparisons, i.e. T test and confidence region/simultaneous intervals
- [ ] *Non-course topics*: K-means or KNN clustering
